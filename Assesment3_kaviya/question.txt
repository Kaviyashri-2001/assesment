1)Differnce between interface and Abstract class:

*In interface multiple  inheritance  can be achieved but in abstract class multiple  inheritance can not be done
*Abstract class contains both declaration and implementation part whereas interface contains only the declaration of methods.
*A class can contain only one abstract class.	
*A class can cantain multiple interface.
*For both interface and Abstract class object can  not be created.It can accessed through derived class

2)Constructor and Object:

Constructor-A special method of the class that is automatically caleed when an object of the class is created is known a constructor.
The constructor name is the same as the class name
A class can have many number of constructors.A constructor does not have any return type.

Object-A combination of data members and methods in a class is known as object.
The data member in the sense the property of the object and the methods are the action performed by the object.
Example: public class Student  
           {  
                int id; 
                String name;
                public void play();  
           }  

3)Virtual and Override:

virtual and override keywords are in method overriding of polymorphism.virtual keyword is used to to modify the methods in base class, 
whereas override keyword is used to modify the methods in derived class.

4)Abstract can be sealed:

Abstract class can not be sealed class because the abstract class should be inherited for accessing its methods.
If it is declared as a selead class it can't be inherited.

5) C# program to convert from degrees Celsius to Kelvin and Fahrenheit from user input given in console:

using System;
public class temperature
{
    double celsius = Double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
    public void Kelvin()
    {
         double kelvin = celsius + 273;
         Console.WriteLine(" The kelvin:{0}",kelvin);
    }
    public void Fahrenheit()
    {
        double fahrenheit= celsius*18/10+32;
         Console.WriteLine("The Fahrenheit:{0}",fahrenheit);
    }
}
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Enter celsius value");
       temperature obj=new temperature();
        obj.Kelvin();
        obj.Fahrenheit();
    }
}
